**Week 2 - Loops**

SPECIFICATIONS

1. camelCase

   In a file called `camel.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.


2. COKE MACHINE

Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

In a file called `coke.py`, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isn’t an accepted denomination.


3. JUST SETTING UP MY TWTTR

   When texting or tweeting, it’s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called  *twttr* . In a file called `twttr.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str `of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.


4. VANITY PLATES

In Massachusetts, home to Harvard University, it’s possible to [request a vanity license plate](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/request-a-vanity-license-plate) for your car, with your choice of letters and numbers instead of random ones. Among the requirements, though, are:

* “All vanity plates must start with at least two letters.”
* “… vanity plates may contain a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters.”
* “Numbers
  cannot be used in the middle of a plate; they must come at the end. For
  example, AAA222 would be an acceptable … vanity plate; AAA22A would not
  be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.”
* “No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”

In `plates.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output `Valid` if meets all of the requirements or `Invalid` if it does not. Assume that any letters in the user’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, wherein `is_valid` returns `True` if `s` meets all requirements and `False` if it does not. Assume that `s` will be a `str`. You’re welcome to implement additional functions for `is_valid` to call (e.g., one function per requirement).

```
def main():
    plate = input("Plate: ")
    if is_valid(plate):
        print("Valid")
    else:
        print("Invalid")


def is_valid(s):
    ...


main()
```


5. NUTRITION FACTS

The U.S. Food & Drug Adminstration (FDA) offers [downloadable/printable posters](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/nutrition-information-raw-fruits-vegetables-and-fish) that “show nutrition information for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits … in the United States. Retail stores are welcome to download the posters, print, display and/or distribute them to consumers in close proximity to the relevant foods in the stores.”

In a file called `nutrition.py`, implement a program that prompts ~consumers~ users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the [FDA’s poster for fruits](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/2/nutrition/Nutrition-Information-for-Raw-Fruits---small-PDF-Poster.pdf), which is also [available as text](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/raw-fruits-poster-text-version-accessible-version). Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., `strawberries`, not `strawberry`). Ignore any input that isn’t a fruit.
