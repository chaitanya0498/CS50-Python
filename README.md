# CS50-Python

Course offered by Harvard

https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/



This repository contains solutions to the problem sets from the course, solved by Chaitanya Bhardwaj. This repository is maintained for potential employers and serves to showcase the learnings from the course.



"An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with
classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files.
Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by
real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac."


P.S. I am trying to set up this repo to have restricted access, and I do not intend to provide solutions to the students taking the course.
The reason this repo is public is because I wanted to share it with potential recruiters. Its visibility will be changed back to private soon.
